# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering tools, methods and principles for the development and maintenance of software systems or products. SE plays a crucial role in the tech industry as it enables the creation and maintenance of software systems and apps that are vital in our day-to-day activities like communication, entertainment, Finance, and healthcare telemedicine.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1948 - Grace hopper developed the first compiler, which translates human-readable code into machine code
1957 - FORTRAN, the first high-level programming language was released
2000 - Agile methodologies become the dominant approach to software engineering


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - Gathering & Documenting information on user needs and system requirements
Design - Creating user interface and design of software architecture
Implementation - Writing code and building software according to design specifications
Testing - QA/QC test to ensure the software meets required needs.
Deployment - Release software to users/customers 
Maintenance - Providing continuous support like system updates even after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall is a sequential, linear progression, step-by-step approach, with distinct phases flowing downwards. Examples of scenarios or projects that can successfully implement this methodology are construction and large-scale engineering projects. etc 
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach which is flexible, collaborative and responds to change, unlike the waterfall. A great Scenario is using the agile method to create an app or website. Iterations make sure prototypes are out faster for testing due to short iterations or sprints.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developers - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - In charge of overseeing the execution, planning and delivery of software project


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are software suites used for writing codes, debugging and testing codes Examples are Xcode, Visual Studio, and Source-code Editor.
VCS also known as source control is a tool used for tracking and managing changes to software code and coordinating work among team members Examples are Helix Core, and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some challenges are tight deadlines, Technical debts, constant changes in requirements 
Some strategies that can be implemented to solve the above challenges are clear and effective communication, reviewing goals and requirements, and Agile methodologies.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - testing of individual components and modules of a software
System testing - Testing the entire system as a whole
Integration testing - testing integration between different components or subsystems
acceptance testing - testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about creating questions and statements, or clear institutions to get the best response from AI models. Prompt engineering is important to help the AI understand specific needs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Omellete (AI will give me every information it has on the omelette in its database, which I do not need, from history, nutritional value to ingredients etc)
Improved prompt: Provide a step-by-step instruction on how to make an omelette (AI will specifically tell me what I need to make an omelette, the ingredients and the steps)
